<!-- ROCK PAPER SCISSORS GAME ALGORITHM -->
 <!-- Created the button for the game ie. Rock,Paper Scissors -->
  <!-- The goal here is to set up the code where when we click a button, the computer randomly selects a move, compare the move to the our choice (our clicked button) to get the result,and we finally display the result in a pop up  -->
   <!-- now we compare our move to the computerMove to get the result -->
    <!-- the last step is to display in a pop us -->
     <!-- we'd be grouping some of our codes into functions as they've been repeated severally. The code for the computerMove has been repeated thrice so we created a function pickComputerMove to hold the code so it could be re-used -->
      <!-- ideally computerMove variable should be out of this function so it could be accessible at the comparison stage and the alert stage however, we can still achieve this by return. -->
       <!-- here, the returned computerMove is equal to the function called, however it must be saved so it becomes accessible -->
        <!-- we can create a function for the code that compares the choices and pass the little differences as parameters -->

        <!-- we need to a section that updates the score whenever the game is played. Here, we create an object outside the scope of the function to do that. the reason for object is that objects can be used to save variables with related information. the object is created outside the scope of the functions so it retains the score of the games played over that period  however, that'll not be the case if its saved in a function as there'll be a new score every time the game is played which is not what we want   -->
         <!-- after comparing moves, we can update the score object.  -->
          <!-- we also set the reset button and onclick, we reset the score object -->
           <!-- after updating the score,we need to save it to localStorage -->
            <!-- our next move is to display the score on the page and as we play the game, update the score which is on the page -->
             <!-- i created an html element, got it into javaScript and set the innerHTML to the score i wanted to display.The javascript object(html in javascript) is updated with the current score immediately when the page loads and this is because,the score is initialized based on the values retrieved from localStorage or defaults to zero if no score exists -->
              <!-- Similarly, the javascript object(html in javascript) is placed into the playGame() so when the game is played, the score aldo gets updated automatically  -->
               <!-- i was able to create a function for the javascript object meant to display the score. ie. updateScoreElement() -->
                <!-- i made the reset button interactive by passing the updateScoreElement() in it so it modifies the score on the page when interacted with -->
                 <!-- The next course is to display the moves of each player ie. (user and computer) and the result after each game on the page  -->
                  <!-- i did this by creating an html element to do the display ie. one for each, got them into javascript specifically into the function and equated both innerHTML to their respective displays -->
                   <!-- style the page -->
                    <!-- with respect the the html elements, which are meant to display after the game is played, i gave them a fake content,styled them and replaced the one's in the code with them(moves that displayed images) -->
                     <!-- AUTOPLAY -->
                      <!-- here, we use the inbuilt setInterval(). setInterval() take two parameters. 1. the function to run 2. time it takes to run (milliseconds). With setInterval the function will keep run after every timeout -->
                       <!-- we use the setInterval() to build the auto play function fo the game -->
                        <!-- first, we create a function in the onclick attribute of the auto play to hold the code. autoPlay() -->
                         <!-- in the autoPlay(), we use setInterval(). the time component is 1000. in the function component, we call the playGame(playerMove) but first we need to define playerMove as the intention is to make the computer play against itself. Notice, we have a function for picking a random move (pickComputerMove). lets equate the playerMove to that so when we finally call the playGame(playerMove), it serves the purpose we wish to achieve. ie. Computer vs Computer -->
                          <!-- the next move is to make it stop playing after clicking on it again -->
                           <!-- here, we state a variable eg. isAutoPlaying = false; and we use this logic in an "if" statement to achieve the required result.you establish a clear starting point for the variable. This indicates that, at the beginning of your program, autoplay is not active.Predictable Behavior: When the program starts, you know that the autoplay feature is off. This predictability is crucial for the logic that follows, as it allows you to make DECISIONS BASED ON THE CURRENT STATE OF THE FLAG. -->
                            <!--we set the variable outside the auto play function so we can reassign the variable(inside the if) after the autoPlay starts.ie. we reassign isAutoPlaying = true; after the game starts playing-->
                            <!-- next, remember that setInterval() returns a number (like an "id") whenever it is called.we'd use the number to stop the interval -->
                             <!-- we create the variable to save the "id" (intervalId) outside the function so it retains the "id" the last time the function was run. inside the function will produce a new id every time -->
                              <!-- with the "id"(intervalId) in place, we stop the game by calling clearInterval() and we pass the "id" into it.ie.clearInterval(intervalId) -->
                               <!-- after stopping, we reassign the variable isAutoPlaying = false -->

                 <!-- to make the code cleaner, we moved all the javascript code embedded in the onclick attribute into a javascript function -->
                  <!-- i made another adjustment in the sense that, i styled the button and used "if" to state an argument that if the button didn't have a particular class(contained another style), then it should include that as a class and change the "innerHTML" to 'Subscribed' and it it already has, should remove that class and revert its 'innerHTML' back to 'subscribe' -->

                <!-- OOPs -->
                 <!-- we are first converting the cart.js into cart-oop. we create a file cart-oop.js for that. here, the goal is to group all the data and functions into an object called cart  -->
                  <!-- we change the first cart to cartItems -->
                   <!-- to access the methods and properties, we need to site the object first and the property.ie cart.cartItems in this scenario-->
                    <!-- we can use "this" to replace the object name so it references the object even when we change the name -->
                     <!-- we can use the object to even add to the cart. we call cart.addToCart('productId') and if we console.log the cart, it'll show it has increased -->
                      <!-- the benefit of using OOP is that you can create multiple objects. we can copy and paste our objects as many times as we like.eg businessCart = {} -->
                       <!-- USING FUNCTIONS TO GENERATE OBJECTS -->
                       <!-- instead of copy pasting the entire object t create a new object, we can use functions to create new objects -->
                        <!-- one advise using OOP is to use PascalCase to things that generate objects -->
                         <!-- we can create a function that hosts the object we want to copy so when we call the function, a new object is created -->
                          <!-- DISCLAIMER: Be aware to change the localStorage name so it doesn't fuse with that of cart.js -->

                          <!-- USING CLASS TO GENERATE OBJECTS -->
                           <!-- Class is basically designed to generate objects -->
                            <!-- we create a class eg. class Cart {} and we put in properties and methods -->
                             <!-- with class the input syntax is slightly  different eg. class Cart{cart = undefined;} instead of an object Cart = {cart:undefined,} -->
                              <!-- after creating the class, i changed the name of the localStorage to localStorageKey and used it as a property with a given value,undefined -->
                               <!-- /we create a new object by new Cart() ie. cart = new Cart() -->
                                <!-- after that, we used cart.localStorageKey to set up the property for the localStorageKey with respect to the new object created ie. cart  -->
                                 <!-- NB; cart.localStorageKey is a set-up code and constructor enables us put the code in the class which makes our codes cleaner -->
                                  <!-- we can pass the value of the cart.localStorageKey as a parameter withing the constructor and access it within through "()" of the new object created so that with each new object created, the object can substitute its own localStorageKey-->

                                  <!-- CONVERTING OUR PRODUCTS INTO A CLASS -->
                                   <!--  In product.js we can use a lass to generate all the objects/products in a the products array-->
                                     <!-- we create a Product class ie. class Product {} -->
                                      <!-- each object/product needs to have certain properties like name.image,priceCents etc so we include them in the Product class so when we create an object it can possess it automatically . we initially set the properties as undefined-->
                                       <!-- when we create a new object say product1 = new Product (),  we need to set up the code for the properties product1 as product1.id = "ghygfhhh". product1.name = "basketball" etc. and notice we'd have to do this for every new object/product we create which would ne too much work. What we can do is set up a constructor with a parameter say "productDetails" and for every new object/product, pass the details of the object through the "()" of the new object to setup the properties. when we console.log() the new product, it should display the new product with the properties -->
                                        <!-- with respect to the products array, we cal loop through it using "map()" and for each object, create a new object whiles already saving it in a variable products.ie. const products = [].map((productDetails) => {
                                         new Product(productDetails)
                                         }); . the reason for map() is that it has  special feature which is , it creates an array and whatever gets returned gets put in the new array. so after the looping through the products array, we can return the function so it gets pit in  new array saved as products-->
                                         <!-- we created a new method getPrice() which we used to substitute the html (formatCurrency()) in amazon.js and orderSummary.js to make the code cleaner -->

                                         <!-- USING INHERITANCE TO CREATE A SPECIFIC TYPE OF PRODUCTS  -->
                                          <!-- we create a class clothing which extends the products array. this si so the clothing acn have access to the properties and methods of the products class without having to copy the entire properties and methods of the products class -->
                                           <!-- Even though the child inherits the properties and methods of the Parent, in the constructor, we need to set these values. However we can bypass that by declaring the constructor in the parent class. We do this by calling a special feature of classes called "super(parameter)"."super(parameter)" basically calls the constructor of the parent class and all the defined attributes in them -->
                                             <!-- the child class too can have specific attributes exclusive to it -->
                                              <!-- the next goal is to convert the objects that have the a discriminator attribute in this case,"type = "clothing" into a clothing class -->
                                               <!-- we go to the already looped products, use the "if" conditions to set up the objects -->
                                                <!-- we can set up a method "extraInfoHTML() which returns `<a>size chart</a>`" and put it in amazon.js html so it displays for all the clothing class products. Remember so set the extraInfoHTML() for the product class and return ""; so that when the product is not a clothing product, it can still work perfectly -->
