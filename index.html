When you define a variable inside a function (a local variable), that variable is created anew each time the function is called. This means that its value is reset to its initial state every time the function runs. -->

In contrast, when you define a variable outside of any function (a global variable), it retains its value across multiple function calls. This allows you to avoid resetting the variable each time the function is executed. -->

Application Entry Point: The main.jsx file is the first JavaScript file that runs when your React application starts. It is responsible for rendering the root component of your application.

Rendering the App: It typically uses the ReactDOM.render() method to render the main component (often called App) into a specific DOM element, usually a <div> with the ID of root in the index.html file.

 -->
  <!-- ReactDOM.render(): This method takes two arguments: the component to render (in this case, <App />) and the DOM element where it should be rendered (document.getElementById('root')).
Wrapping the <App /> component in <React.StrictMode> is optional but recommended during development. It helps identify potential problems in your application. -->
  <!-- App.jsx -  typically serves as the main component of your application. It is where you define the structure and behavior of your app's user interface. It serves as the root component that is rendered in the main.js file. It defines the overall layout and structure of your application, including headers, footers, and main content areas -->
   <!-- The className attribute is used to apply CSS styles -->
    <!-- The App component is exported as the default export, allowing it to be imported in other files (like main.js). -->

    <!-- Difference between index.css and App.css. ./index.css: A CSS file for global styles.eg.header tags,anchor tag,body,etc ./App.css: A CSS file for styles specific to the App component.eg. header component.main component,footer component -->
     <!-- In react,a component refers to a part of the user interface -->
      <!-- App is the component that contains all other components. It is also known as the root component -->
       <!-- components are also reusable.ie. they can be used with different properties to display different information.Component codes are usually placed in javascript files eg. App component is placed in the App.jsx file so basically, components are codes inside a js file -->
        <!-- React has two types of components i.e. Stateless functional Component and Stateful class component  -->

         <!-- Functional Components:are a type of React component that are defined as JavaScript functions. They are used to render UI elements and can accept props (properties) as arguments. Unlike class components, stateless functional components do not manage their own state or lifecycle methods. Instead, they focus solely on rendering the UI based on the props they receive.Basically, functional components optionally receive inputs of properties(props) and return html that describes the UI. Now,you can use the useState and useEffect hooks to add state and lifecycle-like behavior to functional components -->

          <!-- 
         import React from 'react';

// A functional component that receives props
const Greeting = (props) => {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>
    </div>

// Usage of the Greeting component

<!-- BREAKDOWN OF THE EXAMPLE -->
 <!-- Component Definition: The Greeting component is defined as a function that takes props as an argument. It returns JSX that renders a greeting message.

Props: The name prop is passed to the Greeting component when it is used in the App component. The component uses this prop to display a personalized greeting.

Usage: The Greeting component is used twice in the App component, demonstrating how it can be reused with different props -->
<!-- NB:rafce creates a default functional component set up -->

<!-- Here’s a simple example of managing state in a functional component using the useState hook: -->
 <!-- 
import React, { useState } from 'react';

const Counter = () => {
  // Initializing state with useState
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  // Function to handle button click
  const increment = () => {
    setCount(count + 1); // Updating state
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={increment}>Click me</button>
    </div>
  );
};

export default Counter;
 -->

<!--CLASS COMPONENTS: They are regular ES6 classes that "extends" the "component" class from the React library.They must contain a "render method" which in turn returns html/jsx.A class component can maintain a private internal state.ie. it can maintain some information which is private to that component and use that information to describe the user interface -->
<!-- 
import React, { Component } from 'react';

// A class component that manages its own state
class Counter extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Initializing state
    this.state = {
      count: 0,
    };
  }

  // Method to increment the count
  increment = () => {
    this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 });
  };

  // Lifecycle method that runs after the component mounts
  componentDidMount() {
    console.log('Counter component mounted');
  }

  // Lifecycle method that runs before the component unmounts
  componentWillUnmount() {
    console.log('Counter component will unmount');

  // Render method

  );
};

export default App;
-->
<!-- BREAKDOWN OF EXAMPLE -->
 <!-- 
Component Definition: The Counter component is defined as a class that extends React.Component.

Constructor: The constructor initializes the component's state using this.state. The super(props) call is necessary to access this.props in the constructor.

State Management: The component has a count state that tracks the number of times the button has been clicked.

Increment Method: The increment method updates the state using this.setState(), which triggers a re-render of the component.

Lifecycle Methods:

componentDidMount(): This method is called after the component is mounted to the DOM. It can be used for side effects like fetching data.
componentWillUnmount(): This method is called just before the component is removed from the DOM. It can be used for cleanup tasks.
Render Method: The render() method returns the JSX that defines the UI of the component.

<!-- PROPS(PROPERTIES):It is the option of input that your component can accept.It also allows your component to be dynamic.To specify props for a component (in App) we specify them as attributes.-->
 <!-- Sometimes you might not know as to what content is being passed in a component (in App) but you'd want the component file to render such content.
